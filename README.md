# AuctionUmbrella

An auction site that includes items, bids, and users.

Unregistered users can browse the site to view items.

Once users have registered and logged in, they can bid on an item by going to its detail page, entering a bid amount, and clicking "Submit".

Anytime bids are updated, the new bid will be broadcast through a channel to all other users who are currently viewing that item's detail page.
